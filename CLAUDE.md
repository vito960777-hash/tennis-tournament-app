# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Environment Setup

This is a Python 3.13 project with a virtual environment located at `.venv/`.

**Activate the virtual environment:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Run the main script:**
```bash
python hello.py
```

## Project Structure

This is a simple Python learning project. The main script `hello.py` is a basic interactive program that:
- Prints a greeting in Italian
- Prompts for user input (name)
- Responds with a personalized message

The codebase uses Italian for strings and comments, as this appears to be an Italian language learning or demonstration project.
